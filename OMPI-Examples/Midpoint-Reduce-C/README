	  MIDPOINT INTEGRATION using MPI, Kees Lemmens, Febr 2014
	  ========================================================
	       
In this example we split the integration interval into subintervals
and let each processor compute the area for it's local interval using
a Midpoint integration on the subinterval.

After that we use MPI_Reduce to collect and sum all local values on
processor 0.

NOTES :

1) There may be small roundoff errors/differences if you compare the
   sequential and the mpi version.

2) But, for a higher number of steps the result must converge to the
   value we obtain using the sequential algorithm.

3) Note there are no explicit master and slave processes in this
   example: each process has an equal task, except for the global
   result being collected and printed on the first process.
